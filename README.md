## Outline

Do you have a lot of HOMEWORKS?

AND THEN... Are there DIFFERENT SITES to check out homeworks?

If you are with 'RingRing', You can see everything at ONCE

### Birth_Background_of_'RingRing'

Most students take more than one class

But the sites are all different

We are exhausted before we even begin the task.

So I thought, 'How happy would it be if I could see all the tasks at once'

I turned on the computer as soon as I finished thinking.

And Then RingRing was born.

## Used_Technology

While Searching, I met something incredible.
