### Birth Background of RingRing

Most students take more than one class

But the sites are all different

We are exhausted before we even begin the task.

So I thought, 'How happy would it be if I could see all the tasks at once'

I turned on the computer as soon as I finished thinking.

And Then RingRing was born.

## Used Technology

I mainly get information through Google

While Searching, I met something incredible.

### Firebase

I've never learned a database before.

But Firebase Make me very easy To Use Database

### For Professor

Professors should spend some time for students.(The work will probably be done by the assistant professor...)

Register your subject and announce homeworks of the subject once more through the application

(A few efforts can make students more convenient.....Thank you.....)
